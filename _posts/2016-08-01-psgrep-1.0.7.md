I have [tagged version 1.0.7][1.0.7] of [`psgrep(1)`][site], the simple little shell
script to search through your processes, with a focus on GitHub-related
updates. This includes a cleaner [README][README], a [GitHub pages site][site], and updated
[bug reporting links][bugs] for using GitHub. This officially marks the migration of the
psgrep repository, once again, to a new host. Note that this has been mirrored on
GitHub since version [1.0.6][1.0.6] for use with package managers, and now I've also
added release notes for all the historical versions going back to 1.0.3 all the
way from 2007! Oh wow has it been that long? This project has gone through multiple
source code management systems including Subversion, Mercurial, and Git, across at
least two or three different hosts. I can imagine that Git is here to stay for a while,
but they say that about everything.
