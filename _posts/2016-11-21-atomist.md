[Atomist][atomist] is a tool for creating and managing projects in any
programming language or framework. Inspired by various tools such as the
[Spring Initializr][spring-init], [Create React app][react-init],
[Yeoman][yeoman], [Spring Roo][roo], [Lazybones][lazybones] and the various
scaffolding tools included with frameworks such as Rails and Django, Atomist
provides both project generation and editing through both a web interface and
a Slack chat bot. There are
[some publicly available templates and editors][templates] on GitHub
that provide a starting point for creating and modifying projects. Currently
provided templates cover some common frameworks in Java, Go, and Python.
