A friend of mine is trying to find motivation to write more often, so he asked
if I could help motivate him. I suggested keeping a blog which led me to
remember that I used to have one on Github. Here I am recreating this Jekyll-based
site (the old one is still in the git history, but I never really posted much).

Now that I've been working professionally with Java for a few years, I've become
rather opinionated about both Java and professional software development, so
perhaps now I'm at a more appropriate point in my life to actually maintain a
tech blog.

Since this post doesn't have much tech, here's a warmup: the Spring Framework
contains far too much magic for anyone to really understand what the hell it's
doing nowadays. Spring Boot has made huge efforts towards making it even *more*
magic, so I don't see them making things easier to understand anytime soon. At
least the documentation is rather good.
